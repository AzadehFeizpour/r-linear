Skipped limma section. Rushed in teeth section. Skipped multiple testing. Pace was otherwise good.

Formulas were a significant source of confusion:
- dropping the intercept and the factor getting an extra column was very confusing
- ~0 and ~1 models in slideshow were a bit confusing.

Move some discussion of formula syntax earlier.

Maybe go up to four hours to allow time for limma. Still had energy at the end of the workshop.
