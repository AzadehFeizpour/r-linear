## What is a linear model?


## Geometric intuition

Our noise distribution's probability density is a function of the distance from zero. This means it is a spherical blob.

Matrix multiplication and the set of vectors this can produce also have a geometric interpretation.

This means various geometric ideas are applicable:

* distances (Pythagorus!)
* rotations
* right angles
* subspaces: points, lines, planes, etc



## Hypothesis testing


## Geometry of a hypothesis test


## Rejecting a single hypothesis is severely lacking in ambition
